### **ARFoundation Template Project**

Simple base Unity **ARFoundation** (Augmented Reality) **template** project, enhanced from the fantastic 
[Youtube tutorial by The Unity Workbench](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml2UakwRxjk)
This project is meant to springboard other ARFoundation projects by having most of the base components in 
place including scaling and rotation functionality for a single object.

This updates the Unity Workbench project from the link above to **Unity 2019.1.5f1**, as well as updates the way Raycast Hits are 
now managed.  This project adds a simple canvas with slider controls to allow for adding Scaling and Rotation 
functionality, using the session origin component's **MakeContentAppearAt** method.

**Future To-dos:**

1. Ability to have Multiple objects, each with their own scaling and rotation.
