### **ARFoundation Template Project**

Simple base Unity **ARFoundation** (Augmented Reality) **template** 
project, meant to springboard other ARFoundation projects by having most
 of the base components in place including scaling and rotation 
 functionality for a single object.

This project uses **Unity 2020.3.2f1 (LTS)**, and incorporates a few 
scripts from some of the ARFoundation Sample projects to facilitate 
ARKIT/Apple specific oriented Coaching, Checking for AR support, 
and having an intro scene for logo display, instructions, etc. - 
so as to not abruptly go straight into AR before user is ready.

The project currently utilizes Unity Package Manager versions 
4.2.0-pre.4 for all of the ARFoundation/ARCore/ARKit packages.
